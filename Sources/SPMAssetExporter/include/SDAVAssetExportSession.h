/**
 * An `SDAVAssetExportSession` object transcodes the contents of an AVAsset source object to create an output
 * of the form described by specified video and audio settings. It implements most of the API of Apple provided
 * `AVAssetExportSession` but with the capability to provide you own video and audio settings instead of the
 * limited set of Apple provided presets.
 *
 * After you have initialized an export session with the asset that contains the source media, video and audio
 * settings, and the output file type (outputFileType), you can start the export running by invoking 
 * `exportAsynchronouslyWithCompletionHandler:`. Because the export is performed asynchronously, this method
 * returns immediately — you can observe progress to check on the progress.
 *
 * The completion handler you supply to `exportAsynchronouslyWithCompletionHandler:` is called whether the export
 * fails, completes, or is cancelled. Upon completion, the status property indicates whether the export has
 * completed successfully. If it has failed, the value of the error property supplies additional information
 * about the reason for the failure.
